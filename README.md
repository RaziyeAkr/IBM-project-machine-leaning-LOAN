This notebook is a machine learning project with classification to recognize payment and non-payment.<br>
Four different classification algorithms have been used in this notebook and these algorithms have been evaluated in three ways.<br>
This project is related to the final project related to the **IBM machine learning course at Coursera** that I took.<br>
I hope you enjoy it and find it useful.
